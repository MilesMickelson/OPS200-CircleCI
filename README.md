CircleCI workshop project for continuous deployment integrated with Heroku. Allows for live updates to be 
deployed to linked server without constantly pushing to it.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
